## 🎯 Objective of the Analysis

To analyze the relationship between:

- Market Sentiment (Fear vs Greed)
- Trader Actions (profitability, risk-taking, leverage, volume)

Key questions explored:

- Do traders use more leverage in a **Greed** market?
- Is **profitability** higher during Greed phases?
- Do losses increase during **Fear** sentiment?
- Does trading volume follow Fear/Greed cycles?
